After researching the Mattermost GitHub ecosystem, I've identified several key areas to enhance our integration with advanced     
     features, better APIs, and improved monitoring capabilities. Each phase includes comprehensive logging and manual testing        
    procedures.

    1. Upgrade to Official Mattermost Client Library

    Current State

    - Using custom WebSocket manager
    - Manual REST API calls

    Enhancement

    - Replace with @mattermost/client (official TypeScript library)
    - Provides better WebSocket handling, automatic reconnection, and comprehensive API coverage
    - More reliable and maintainable than our custom implementation

    Logging Implementation

    - Server-side logs: API connection status, client initialization, error handling
    - Browser console logs: WebSocket connection events, message processing, client state changes
    - Database logs: Activity storage success/failure, performance metrics

    Manual Testing Steps

    1. Verify client library installation and initialization
    2. Test WebSocket connection with detailed console output
    3. Monitor activity capture and storage in real-time
    4. Test reconnection scenarios (disconnect/reconnect network)
    5. Validate error handling and fallback mechanisms

    2. Implement Advanced Integration Features

    Bot Integration

    - Create official bot user for our dashboard
    - Implement slash commands for dashboard queries (e.g., /dashboard stats, /dashboard activities)
    - Add interactive message buttons for quick actions

    Webhook Enhancements

    - Implement incoming webhooks for external system notifications
    - Add outgoing webhooks for sending dashboard alerts to channels
    - Create interactive message menus for dashboard navigation

    Logging Implementation

    - Bot logs: Command execution, response generation, permission checks
    - Webhook logs: Incoming/outgoing requests, payload validation, delivery status
    - Interactive logs: Button clicks, menu selections, user interactions

    Manual Testing Steps

    1. Create bot user and verify authentication
    2. Test each slash command with different parameters
    3. Send test messages via incoming webhooks
    4. Trigger outgoing webhooks and verify delivery
    5. Test interactive buttons and menus functionality
    6. Verify bot permissions and access controls

    3. Enhanced Analytics & Monitoring

    Performance Metrics Integration

    - Implement Mattermost's performance monitoring metrics API
    - Add Prometheus/Grafana-style metrics collection
    - Create comprehensive system health dashboard

    Analytics Plugin Inspiration

    - Study the community analytics plugin for advanced features
    - Implement user activity analytics
    - Add channel usage statistics and engagement metrics

    Logging Implementation

    - Metrics logs: Data collection timestamps, metric values, aggregation results
    - Performance logs: API response times, database query performance, system resources
    - Analytics logs: User activity patterns, channel usage stats, trend analysis

    Manual Testing Steps

    1. Verify metrics collection and storage
    2. Test dashboard visualization updates
    3. Monitor performance metric accuracy
    4. Validate analytics calculations
    5. Test real-time metric updates
    6. Verify historical data retention

    4. Advanced Admin Features

    Multi-Team Support

    - Extend dashboard to support multiple Mattermost teams
    - Add team-specific analytics and reporting
    - Implement role-based access controls

    Real-time Notifications

    - Push notifications for critical system events
    - Real-time alerts for workflow failures
    - Dashboard-to-Mattermost notification bridge

    Logging Implementation

    - Admin logs: User access, permission changes, configuration updates
    - Notification logs: Alert triggers, delivery status, user acknowledgments
    - Security logs: Authentication attempts, authorization failures, suspicious activity

    Manual Testing Steps

    1. Test multi-team data segregation
    2. Verify role-based access controls
    3. Test notification delivery and acknowledgment
    4. Validate security permission enforcement
    5. Test admin configuration changes
    6. Verify audit trail completeness

    5. API Improvements

    RESTful API Enhancement

    - Implement proper pagination for large datasets
    - Add filtering and search capabilities
    - Create API rate limiting and caching

    WebSocket Event Expansion

    - Capture more event types (reactions, file uploads, user status changes)
    - Implement event filtering and processing rules
    - Add real-time dashboard updates via WebSocket

    Logging Implementation

    - API logs: Request/response details, pagination info, filter application
    - WebSocket logs: Event types captured, processing time, filtering results
    - Cache logs: Hit/miss ratios, invalidation events, performance gains

    Manual Testing Steps

    1. Test API pagination with large datasets
    2. Verify filtering and search functionality
    3. Test rate limiting behavior
    4. Monitor cache performance
    5. Test all WebSocket event types
    6. Verify real-time update delivery

    6. Integration Ecosystem

    Plugin Development

    - Create custom Mattermost plugin for dashboard integration
    - Add dashboard widgets directly in Mattermost interface
    - Implement two-way communication between systems

    Third-party Integrations

    - GitHub integration for development workflows
    - Trello/Jira integration for project management
    - Calendar integration for scheduling

    Logging Implementation

    - Plugin logs: Installation, activation, hook execution
    - Integration logs: Third-party API calls, data synchronization, error handling
    - Communication logs: Bidirectional data flow, message routing, protocol compliance

    Manual Testing Steps

    1. Test plugin installation and activation
    2. Verify dashboard widgets in Mattermost
    3. Test two-way communication flows
    4. Validate third-party integrations
    5. Test data synchronization accuracy
