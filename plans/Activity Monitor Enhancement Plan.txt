Activity Monitor Enhancement Plan

     Current Problems Identified

     - Raw technical user IDs (mgm9oeveepr8r4gpicborvt8a) instead of readable usernames
     - Cryptic channel IDs (smtmwatthzfqt7gubo6rf2743n) instead of channel names
     - Generic event types (message_posted) without context
     - No message content preview
     - Technical timestamps instead of relative time
     - No actionable elements (can't click to view/navigate)
     - Poor visual hierarchy - all entries look the same

     Enhancement Plan

     1. Create Enhanced Activity Display Component

     - Build EnhancedActivityCard.tsx with rich, contextual information
     - Replace raw IDs with human-readable names and previews
     - Add visual hierarchy with better icons, colors, and typography

     2. User & Channel Resolution

     - Create utility functions to resolve user IDs to actual usernames
     - Create utility functions to resolve channel IDs to readable channel names
     - Cache resolved names for performance

     3. Rich Content Display

     - Show message previews (first 50-100 characters)
     - Display user avatars and channel icons
     - Add event-specific formatting (messages, reactions, file uploads, etc.)
     - Show relative timestamps ("2 minutes ago" vs technical timestamps)

     4. Interactive Elements

     - Add "View Message" button to jump to specific messages in channels
     - Make channel names clickable to navigate to that channel
     - Add user profile hover cards
     - Include copy-to-clipboard functionality for technical details

     5. Visual Improvements

     - Color-coded platform indicators
     - Event-type specific icons (üí¨ for messages, ‚ù§Ô∏è for reactions, üìé for files)
     - Better spacing and typography
     - Status indicators (new, processing, completed)
     - Grouping by time periods or channels

     6. Enhanced Filtering & Search

     - Add message content to search functionality
     - Filter by specific users or channels (with dropdown autocomplete)
     - Add date range picker
     - Quick filters for common scenarios ("My messages", "Mentions", "Files")

     7. Real-time Updates

     - Auto-refresh activity list
     - Highlight new activities
     - Add activity counters and badges

     Files to Modify

     1. components/AdminDashboardPage.tsx - Main activity display logic
     2. components/EnhancedActivityCard.tsx - New rich activity card component (create)
     3. lib/activity-helpers.ts - ID resolution utilities (create)
     4. styles/activity-monitor.css - Enhanced styling (create)

     Expected Outcome

     Transform the technical activity log into a user-friendly, actionable feed that shows:
     - "John Doe posted in #general-chat" (instead of technical IDs)
     - "Hey team, the new feature is ready!" (message preview)
     - "2 minutes ago" (relative time)
     - Clickable elements to view full message or navigate to channel
