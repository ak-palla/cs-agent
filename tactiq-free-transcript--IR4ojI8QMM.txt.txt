00:00:32.238 here's a quick look at flock platform
00:00:34.000 capabilities starting with
00:00:36.440 notifications apps can send
00:00:38.160 notifications directly into flock by
00:00:40.600 simply sending an HTTP request to our
00:00:42.960 API endpoint this can help notify
00:00:45.760 individuals or channels about specific
00:00:48.039 updates for example a GitHub app can
00:00:51.120 send a message to a channel whenever
00:00:52.920 someone opens an issue a Trello app can
00:00:55.600 notify the project manager whenever a
00:00:58.079 card is created or moved notifications
00:01:01.160 help users get realtime updates on
00:01:03.160 information they value the most flock OS
00:01:06.720 offers deep integration into the flock
00:01:09.960 UI apps can add buttons to
00:01:13.159 attachments chat
00:01:15.320 tabs the attachment pick a
00:01:18.560 bar and the app launcher bar these
00:01:21.880 buttons can be used to launch widgets
00:01:24.479 for example the Cod snippet app has an
00:01:27.079 attachment picker button which on
00:01:29.240 clicking open opens a modal widget where
00:01:31.200 users can enter
00:01:34.159 code similarly the to-do app provides an
00:01:37.399 app launcher button which can be used to
00:01:39.680 launch the to-do sidebar widget buttons
00:01:42.960 and widgets are platform agnostic and
00:01:45.560 can be used in both flock desktop and
00:01:47.680 flock mobile clients for example here is
00:01:51.560 the attachment picker button for the
00:01:53.119 notes app in the mobile
00:01:56.719 client buttons can also be used to
00:01:59.159 trigger messages
00:02:00.479 or launch a browser outside
00:02:02.770 [Music]
00:02:04.560 flock besides buttons users can also
00:02:07.560 interact with your app using the app's
00:02:09.758 dedicated SL command once the command is
00:02:12.720 executed your app can respond in any way
00:02:15.239 you want it to send messages open
00:02:18.239 Widgets or launch browser
00:02:22.440 instances each app also gets a dedicated
00:02:25.239 bot to send and receive messages to
00:02:27.200 users and channels like this reminder
00:02:29.200 bot
00:02:31.519 which sends notifications for tasks to
00:02:33.440 be
00:02:38.680 done with URL previews when a user types
00:02:42.200 a URL your app can show a preview for
00:02:44.760 that so if a user enters a Google Drive
00:02:47.720 Link a Google Drive app can show a
00:02:50.159 preview for that link including the
00:02:52.440 document name type Etc URL previews help
