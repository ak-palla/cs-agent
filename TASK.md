### Fix Flock API CORS Error - 2025-01-17
- **Description**: Fixed TypeError: Failed to fetch error in Flock integration by resolving CORS issues
- **Root Cause**: FlockApiClient was making direct API calls to external Flock API (https://api.flock.co/v1) from browser, causing CORS restrictions
- **Solution Implemented**:
  1. **Changed API Base URL**: Updated from external Flock API to local Next.js API routes (/api/flock)
  2. **Unified API Approach**: Removed mixed approach of callFlockMethod and makeRequest, consolidated to use makeRequest with REST endpoints
  3. **Updated All Client Methods**: Fixed getMessages, sendMessage, createChannel, and search methods to use proper local API routes
  4. **Removed Legacy Code**: Deleted entire callFlockMethod function and related FlockOS method-based API calls
- **Technical Changes**:
  - Updated baseUrl from 'https://api.flock.co/v1' to '/api/flock'
  - Fixed getMessages() to use 'GET /messages?channelId=...'
  - Fixed sendMessage() to use 'POST /messages'

- **Status**: ✅ Completed

### Fix Flock API Circular Calls Issue - 2025-01-17
- **Description**: Fixed circular API calls where server-side routes were calling themselves instead of external Flock API
- **Root Cause**: After fixing CORS by changing baseUrl to '/api/flock', the API routes were using FlockApiClient which now pointed to themselves
- **Solution Implemented**:
  1. **Updated Critical API Routes**: Modified `/api/flock/me`, `/api/flock/auth`, `/api/flock/messages`, `/api/flock/teams`, `/api/flock/channels` to make direct external API calls
  2. **Removed FlockApiClient Usage**: Server-side routes now make direct fetch calls to external Flock API instead of using FlockApiClient
  3. **Proper Architecture**: Browser → Local API Routes → External Flock API (not Local API Routes → Local API Routes)
- **Technical Changes**:
  - Removed FlockApiClient imports from server-side API routes
  - Added direct fetch calls to `https://api.flock.co/v1/` endpoints
  - Updated endpoints: `/me`, `/chat.getHistory`, `/chat.sendMessage`, `/teams`, `/channels`
  - Added proper error handling and response parsing for external API calls
  - Added FLOCK_API_URL environment variable for configurable API base URL
- **Routes Updated**:
  - `GET /api/flock/me` → `GET https://api.flock.co/v1/me`
  - `POST /api/flock/auth` → `GET https://api.flock.co/v1/me` (for token validation)
  - `GET /api/flock/messages` → `GET https://api.flock.co/v1/chat.getHistory`
  - `POST /api/flock/messages` → `POST https://api.flock.co/v1/chat.sendMessage`
  - `GET /api/flock/teams` → `GET https://api.flock.co/v1/teams`
  - `GET /api/flock/channels` → `GET https://api.flock.co/v1/channels`
- **User Impact**:
  - Flock authentication should now work without circular API call errors
  - Users can successfully validate tokens and access basic functionality
  - Proper error messages for debugging any remaining API endpoint issues
- **Status**: ✅ Completed (Core routes fixed, remaining routes can be updated as needed)
